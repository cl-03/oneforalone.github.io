# Yuqi's Notebook

After trying Jekyll for one year, and experience with sphinx, I made my choice that migrating my blog
from Jekyll to Sphinx. For the Jekyll Version, it's archived to https://github.com/oneforalone/blog.archived

Usage:

* Install requirements:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Preview on local:

```bash
sphinx-autobuild source build/html
```

* Build for github

```bash
make github
```
